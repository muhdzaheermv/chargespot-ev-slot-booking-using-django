Project Title: ChargeSpot – EV Station Slot Booking System  

Project Description:  
ChargeSpot is an advanced web-based platform designed to streamline the booking and management of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations. Developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQLite, and Django, the system provides a seamless experience for EV owners, station operators, and administrators. It enables real-time slot availability tracking, online payments, and automated booking confirmations, making EV charging more accessible and efficient.  

The system consists of three primary modules:  

1. EV Station Operator Module – Allows operators to register, create and manage charging stations, offer additional services like car wash or technical support, handle bookings, and provide customer support.  
2. EV Owner Module – Enables EV owners to search for charging stations, check real-time charger availability, book slots, make payments through UPI or other methods, and receive booking confirmations via email. They can also modify or cancel reservations as needed.  
3. Admin Module – Provides full control over the system, including user management, station approvals, monitoring of bookings, and generating reports.  

Additionally, the platform includes a user manual to assist new users in navigating the system effortlessly. By integrating real-time booking management, service customization, and automated notifications, ChargeSpot enhances the EV charging experience, ensuring convenience for both EV owners and charging station operators.
